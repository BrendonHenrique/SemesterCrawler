# SemesterCrawler
Application created for study web crawling techniques using Nodejs + Cheerio  
Also using institutional site from my university ( https://institucional.ufpel.edu.br/cursos/cod/3900 ) as source of data.

The main idea is to crawlling all disciplines listed inside the site, and parse it to javascript object.

Some ideias for the future are : 
  - Using some schedule algorithm, to create some possibilities of combination for the current semester.
